Hi, I'm [Rajat], an [ML, NLP] Researcher

What could possibly be a virtual verse? A Personal Computer?

Why Information is the new HIGH?

Hello There!
A Famous Saying by Elon Musk-
"Failure is an option here. If things are not failing, you are not innovating enough."


I am Rajat Kumar. Recently completed my M. Tech @ DA-IICT, Gandhinagar. Being a Science lover, I have always shown interest in knowing the truth about anything I pursue. For Example, the truth about why to become an engineer? Why to choose a research path?

Well, every question has a so called "Relative Answer" not an "Absolute Answer". Which certainely makes this world "Unpredictable" and "Curious".

Can't put the phenomenal experience of holding a meaningful pathway ahead after being a sincere M. Tech student at DA-IICT in a few lines. The DREAM that one sees should be BIG enough and WORK-OUT harder to achieve them. Further, I don't perceive a distinction between Time-Pass and Passing-The-Time. I believe learning new things is an immeasurable time pass. By the way, to let you know, Success is a Social-Construct. 

Thanks
