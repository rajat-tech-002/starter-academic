Can't put the phenomenal experience of holding a meaningful pathway ahead after being a sincere M. Tech student at [Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology](https://www.daiict.ac.in/) in a few lines. I was supervised by [Prof. Amit Mankodi](https://www.daiict.ac.in/profile/amit-mankodi/) and co-supervised by [Dr. Amit Bhatt](https://www.daiict.ac.in/profile/amit-bhatt/) and [Dr. Bhaskar Chaudhary](https://www.daiict.ac.in/profile/bhaskar-chaudhury/).

`<The DREAM that one sees should be BIG enough and WORK-OUT harder to achieve them. Further, I don't perceive a distinction between Time-Pass and Passing-The-Time. I believe learning new things is an immeasurable time pass. By the way, to let you know, Success is a Social-Construct.>`
