With over 4+ years of experience in Research and Development, 250+ google scholar
citations, and a master’s degree in Machine Intelligence, I currently serve as a data
scientist at Philips Innovation Strategy, where my work is driven by a commitment
to enhancing patient outcomes. Collaborating closely with clinical scientists and
data architects, I analyze complex numerical, textual, and image datasets to de-
velop machine learning models that prioritize patient impact.
Previously, I worked as a researcher at TCS Innovation Lab, focusing on developing
NLP-based models for intent detection and discovery using large language models (LLMs). Additionally, I gained hands-on experience during my internship at IIT
Gandhinagar, where I worked on the development of energy disaggregation algorithms, specifically utilizing the Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring Toolkit (NILMTK) for
smart buildings.

Can't put the phenomenal experience of holding a meaningful pathway ahead after being a sincere M. Tech student at [Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology](https://www.daiict.ac.in/) in a few lines. I was supervised by [Prof. Amit Mankodi](https://www.daiict.ac.in/profile/amit-mankodi/) and co-supervised by [Dr. Amit Bhatt](https://www.daiict.ac.in/profile/amit-bhatt/) and [Dr. Bhaskar Chaudhary](https://www.daiict.ac.in/profile/bhaskar-chaudhury/).

`<The DREAM that one sees should be BIG enough and WORK-OUT harder to achieve them. Further, I don't perceive a distinction between Time-Pass and Passing-The-Time. I believe learning new things is an immeasurable time pass. By the way, to let you know, Success is a Social-Construct.>`
