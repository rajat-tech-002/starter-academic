# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.

summary: In this paper, we have have described two key improvements to NILMTK; a rewritten model interface to simplify authoring of new disaggregation algorithms, and a new experiment API through which algorithmic comparisons can be specified with relatively little model knowledge. In addition, we have introduced NILMTKcontrib, a new repository containing 3 benchmarks and 9 modern disaggregation algorithms. In addition, such algorithms will be continuously evaluated in a range of pre-defined scenarios to produce an ongoing NILM competition
